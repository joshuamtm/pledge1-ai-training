## üìä Coverage Analysis

### Fully Addressed (‚úÖ)
1. Navigation bar showing COMPAS framework position
2. Color coding for different slide types
3. Updated terminology (Share instead of Super You)
4. Reduced ESG-specific content
5. Screen real estate optimization
6. Fixed slide numbering issues
7. Updated Slack channel references

### Partially Addressed (‚ö†Ô∏è)
1. Section breaks - Color coding provides visual separation but no explicit divider slides

### Visual Improvements
- Slides now use 94% of screen width (up from 88%)
- Height increased to 88vh for better vertical space usage
- Larger fonts and increased padding for better readability
- Subtle background gradients distinguish content types

## Testing Recommendations
1. Open index.html in browser to verify navigation bars display correctly
2. Check color coding is visible on different slide types
3. Confirm increased size improves readability
4. Test navigation between slides maintains visual consistency

## Notes
- All changes preserve existing functionality
- Presentation remains responsive for different screen sizes
- Color scheme maintains Pledge 1% and MTM branding consistency
